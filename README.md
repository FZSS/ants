ants
====

Ants vs. Bees, a Plants vs. Zombies like game written in python with GUI. This is a project of the CS61A course at UC Berkeley.



To play a text-based game, use:
```bash
python3 ants.py
```

To play a graphical game, use:
```bash
python3 ants_gui.py
```

There are many options to configure:
>   -h, --help      Prints this help message 
>   -t, --ten       Start with ten food 
>   -f, --full      Loads a full layout and assault plan 
>   -w, --water     Loads a full layout with water 
>   -i, --insane    Loads a difficult assault plan

I recommend trying
```bash
python3 ants_gui.py -f -w -t
```
